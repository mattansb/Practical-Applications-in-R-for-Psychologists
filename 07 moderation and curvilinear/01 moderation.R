# Last time we saw that R doesn't need you to make dummy variables - if can deal
# with factors just fine. Today we will see that this is also true for
# moderation and interactions!
# (I will not be showing how to do these the long way...)





# Categorical moderator ---------------------------------------------------

# Let's prep the data for modeling:
parental_iris <- parental_iris |>
  mutate(
    attachment = relevel(factor(attachment), ref = "secure"),
    involvement_c = center(parental_involvement)
  )
# Here we don't want to get z scores (or maybe we do?) just to center the
# variable around 0.





## 1. Fit the model(s) ----------------------------------------------------

m_additive <- lm(child_satisfaction ~ involvement_c + attachment,
                 data = parental_iris)


# all you need is to tell R to add an interaction!
m_moderation <- lm(child_satisfaction ~ involvement_c + attachment + involvement_c:attachment,
                   data = parental_iris)
# or use `*` -- A * B = A + B + A:B
m_moderation <- lm(child_satisfaction ~ involvement_c * attachment,
                   data = parental_iris)


# Does the model with an interaction have a better fit?
compare_performance(m_additive, m_moderation)
anova(m_additive, m_moderation)
bayesfactor_models(m_moderation, denominator = m_additive)



# Look at the parameters. What do they mean?
model_parameters(m_moderation)






## 2. Explore the model  --------------------------------------------------
# simple slope analysis!

# We don't (just) care about the model's parameters - what we usually care about
# are the different estimates the model can give us - the simple (conditional)
# slopes.

emtrends(m_moderation, ~ attachment, var = "involvement_c",
         infer = TRUE)

# we can also use contrasts here to COMPARE slopes:
emtrends(m_moderation, ~ attachment, var = "involvement_c") |>
  contrast(method = "pairwise",
           infer = TRUE)


## Plot
ggemmeans(m_moderation, c("involvement_c","attachment")) |>
  plot(add.data = TRUE, jitter = 0)





# Continuous moderator ----------------------------------------------------


## Prep the data
parental_iris <- parental_iris |>
  mutate(
    strictness_c = center(parental_strictness)
  )



## 1. Fit the model(s) ----------------------------------------------------

m_additive <- lm(child_satisfaction ~ involvement_c + strictness_c,
                 data = parental_iris)
m_moderation <- lm(child_satisfaction ~ involvement_c * strictness_c,
                   data = parental_iris)

# compare models:
compare_performance(m_additive, m_moderation)
anova(m_additive, m_moderation)
bayesfactor_models(m_additive, m_moderation)



# Look at the parameters. What do they mean?
model_parameters(m_moderation)








## 2. Explore the model  --------------------------------------------------
# simple slope analysis!

emtrends(m_moderation, ~ strictness_c, var = "involvement_c")
# Unfortunately, emmeans/emmtrends reduce covariables (numerical predictors) to
# their mean! If we want to probe the moderation at other multiple values, we
# have two ways to do so:





### A. Probe with a function --------
emtrends(m_moderation, ~strictness_c, "involvement_c",
         # Reduce `strictness_c` to its mean+-sd:
         cov.reduce = list(strictness_c = mean_sd),
         infer = TRUE)


ggemmeans(m_moderation, c("involvement_c","strictness_c [meansd]")) |>
  plot(add.data = TRUE, jitter = 0)





### B. Pick-a-point --------
# We can also ask for specific values at which to probe:

emtrends(m_moderation, ~strictness_c, "involvement_c",
         # Probe when `strictness_c` is -4, 78
         at = list(strictness_c = c(-4, 78)),
         infer = TRUE)


ggemmeans(m_moderation, c("involvement_c","strictness_c [-4, 78]")) |>
  plot(add.data = TRUE, jitter = 0)



# Once again, note that in R, model fitting and hypothesis testing are not as
# closely knit as they are in SPSS. For simple slope analysis, in SPSS, we would
# re-fit new models for each simple slope, in R we instead (1) fit a model, (2)
# test the simple slope of interest.





# Categorical by Categorical ----------------------------------------------

# What about a categorical variable moderating the effect of another categorical
# variable? We can do that just the same! We will see more of this in a few
# weeks, when we talk about ANOVAs...




# Exercise ----------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. The `ggeffects::johnson_neyman()` function can be used to plot a
#   Johnson-Neyman plot. What does it do? (Hint, read the axis titles.)
jn <- ggemmeans(m_moderation, c("involvement_c","strictness_c")) |>
  johnson_neyman()
jn

plot(jn)


# 2. Fit the same moderation model with the original *non-centered* predictors.
#    How does it differ from the moderation model with the centered predictors?
#    A. How do the parameters differ? Interpret them.
#    B. How does the model fit (R^2) differ?
#    C. How do the simple slopes analysis differ?
